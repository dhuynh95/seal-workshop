    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is an encryption scheme, which allows data owners to encrypt their data, and let a third party perform computations on it, without knowing what is the underlying data. The result of the computations on encrypted data can then be sent back to the data owner, which will be the only one able to decrypt the encrypted result.\n",
    "\n",
    "HE enables computation to be performed on encrypted data, while preserving the decryption output, as it leverages homomorphic properties of the encryption and the decryption. This means that addition and multiplication can be done on encrypted data, and the decryption output will be as if those operations were done directly on the unencrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a ring homomorphism $h$ between two rings $R$ and $R'$, follows those two properties : \n",
    "$$h(x + y) = h(x) + h(y)$$\n",
    "$$h(x * y) = h(x) * h(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we have an encryption homomorphism $e$, a decryption homomorphism $d$, such that $d(e(x)) = x$, and a function $f$, which is a composition of additions and multiplications, then we can have the following scenario :\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user encrypts their data $x$ using $e$, and sends $e(x)$ to an untrusted third party.\n",
    "- The third party performs computations $f$ on the encrypted $e(x)$. Because $e$ is an homomorphism, we have that $f(ex(x)) = e(fx)$. Then the third party sends the data back to the user.\n",
    "- Finally the user decrypts the output, obtaining then $d(e(f(x))) = f(x)$, without exposing her data directly to the untrusted third party."

    "- The user then first encodes a complex vector, on which computation will be done, into a plaintext polynomial.\n",

    "When using the CKKS scheme, one has to choose two important parameters :\n",
    "\n",
    "- $q$ the modulus used in the computation. Most computations will be done modulo $q$. \n",
    "- $N$ the degree of the polynomial modulus. This will help us define the plaintext and ciphertext space, as we will use  $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^N + 1)$ as the plaintext space, and $\\mathcal{R_q} = \\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^N + 1)$ as the ciphertext space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that the higher $N$ implies higher security, but also more computations. On the other hand, the higher $q$, the more multiplications we will be able to perform, but it makes the system weaker.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because the plaintext and ciphertext space are polynomial spaces, we must first encode our input, which will be a complex vector $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N/2}$, into a polynomial $m(X) \\in \\mathcal{R}$. This is done by polynomial interpolation on the roots of $X^N + 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to consider, is that when a vector is encoded, we will have to choose a scale $\\Delta > 0$, which will represent how precise we want our computation to be. The caveat is that the higher $\\Delta$, the bigger $q$, and therefore we need to have higher $N$ to compensate to keep the system secure.\n",

    "CKKS is a public encryption scheme, where the user will generate a secret key $s_k$, and a public key $p_k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that the user will sample $a$ a mask, $s_k$ a secret key, and $e$ a small noise. $s_k$ will be used for decryption, while $a$ and $e$ are used to generate a public key. The public key $p_k$ will then be :\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that all the quantities above are polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The security of CKKS is based on the fact that is extremely hard to find $s_k$ from the equation $b = - a s_k + e$. This problem is called the Ring Learning With Error, and is quantum secure, which means not crackable by quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the public key $p_k$, a user can encrypt a plaintext $m$ using the public key $p_k$ by outputing the ciphertext : \n",
    "$c = (b + m, a) = (c_0, c_1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to decrypt the message, one simply needs to use the secret key and compute : \n",
    "$c_0 + s_k c_1 = b + m + s_k a = -a s_k + e + m + s_k a = m + e$, because $b = -a s_k + e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that after decrypting we obtain $m +e$, with $m$ our original message, and $e$ a small error polynomial. So we do not exactly get the original $m$ but one that is slightly disturbed by a small noise $e$, but if the noise is small enough we should have $m + e \\approx m$."

    "\n",
    "- Instead of needing two polynomials to decrypt using the secret key, three polynomials are required to decrypt a ciphertext after a multiplication. This means that the size has increased, and to keep the size of the ciphertext constant, we must relinearize it to go from three polynomials to only two.\n",
    "- The scale will have changed, as if we multiply two ciphertexts, one encrypting $\\Delta x$, and another one $\\Delta y$, then the output will be $\\Delta^2 xy$, therefore the scale has increased, and if we do nothing the encrypted value will overflow and we will not be able to recover it. That's why we need to rescale the output, using one of the primes we will define in $q$, but in doing so, we reduce the number of multiplications left."

    "\n",
    "Once you have all this information, you can set $q$ using the following strategy : \n",
    "- Choose a 60-bit prime as the first prime in coeff_modulus. This will give the highest precision when decrypting\n",
    "- Choose another 60-bit prime as the last element of coeff_modulus, as this will be used as the special prime and should be as large as the largest of the other primes.\n",
